This is my javascript chess project for young students to learn chess tactics, opening principles, master fundamental checkmates.

This version was made in MEAN

I used an ajax request to send create request instead of calling the angular because I'm using ChessBoardJS's jquery library.
So I may re-create this project without angular.

Another issue that is how large my index.html file is growing...

I have the idea to figure out how a chess engine works... and modify it so the user can play Sacrifice City against the computer.

Ideas I want to implment:

-students earn points, acheive badges (needs login and registration)
-chess engine ( sac city, monster, bobby fischer chess )
-play computer to master RR, QK,  RK checkmates
-play computer to master pawn end games

-quizzes for students to test their understanding of opening traps
--fried liver, scholar's mate
--probably use jquery
